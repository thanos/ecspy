"""
    This module provides pre-defined migrators for evolutionary computations.

    All migrator functions have the following arguments:
    
    - *random* -- the random number generator object
    - *population* -- the population of Individuals
    - *args* -- a dictionary of keyword arguments
    
    Each migrator function returns the updated population.

    This callable class allows individuals to migrate from one process 
    to another on the same machine. It maintains a queue of migrants
    whose maximum length can be fixed via the ``max_migrants``
    parameter in the constructor. If the number of migrants in the queue
    reaches this value, new migrants are not added until earlier ones
    are consumed. The unreliability of a multiprocessing environment
    makes it difficult to provide guarantees. However, migrants are 
    theoretically added and consumed at the same rate, so this value
    should determine the "freshness" of individuals, where smaller
    queue sizes provide more recency.
    
    An optional keyword argument in ``args`` requires the migrant to be
    evaluated by the current EC before being inserted into the population.
    This can be important when different populations use different
    evaluation functions and you need to be able to compare "apples with
    apples".
    
    Optional keyword arguments in args:
    
    - *evaluate_migrant* -- should new migrants be evaluated before 
      adding them to the population (default: False)
