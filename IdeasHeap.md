**Some uncorrelated ideasâ€¦**

  * Fitness approximation might be useful?
  * It would be fun to see if we can write a meta-evolution example that optimizes the components and parameters of the GA for a particular problem...
  * Grammatical evolution could be practical when evolving designs, since knowledge can more easily integrated than most paradigms
  * Constraints could be implemented ( Lagrange multipliers? )
